# Darkest-Dungeon-PyMeow-Trainer

basic/crude trainer I made to practice with the PyMeow library. 

The DDOffsets file could be useful to you when making your own hack, even outside of PyMeow. 

In Action:

Known Issues: 

The Overlay makes the screen go black. This only happens to me in Darkest Dungeon and may not be something I can fix without altering PyMeow source. Any advice appreciated, though. 

Updating the game "breaks" the hack - this is expected and unavoidable as I cannot predict changes made to the game binary; all memory-based hacks deal with this logisitcal hurdle. 
If DDOffsets is broken, open an issue and I can fix it easily. Or you could fix it yourself and submit a PR :)
